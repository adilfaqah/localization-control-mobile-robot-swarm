# localization-control-mobile-robot-swarm
Summary: This repository containts the ROS workspace for a project that utilizes the ArUco library in C++, along with Python code, for the localization and centralized control of a swarm of mobile robots.

This project was accomplished as a result of my research at the Human Oriented Robotics and Control (HORC) Lab at Arizona State University.
